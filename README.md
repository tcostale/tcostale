## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Thomas. This is my special repository, where I'm practicing markdown, instead of HTML, which are two very different things.

### About Me and School
I'm currently a junior level student working towards a GIT degree, specializing in photography and film. My interests include photography and video editing (no surprises there), but also include gaming, and most recently lock picking.

I'm attending ASU through Starbucks College Achievement Plan, where I have been working for over 10 years. I started as a barista and promoted all the way up to Store Manager Trainer, before I suffered a work injury. During recovery, I stepped down to Shift Supervisor and began attending school to further my horizons and obtain a college degree.

### Skills and Hobbies
- I came intoGIT 215 knowing a little bit about HTML. I had a class way back in highschool that had a brief section where we covered the basics, and most recently, one of the college courses I took last Fall had a small section covering HTML as well.

- What I'm really into is video and photography. I kind of consider myself a professional amateur, if that makes sense. You can see examples of what I've done in the links below.

- I've also developed my skills in the Adobe Creative Suite, having experience with Photoshop, Lightroom,  Illustrator, After Effects, etc. Having a background in photography, I'm most comfortable using Photoshop and Lightroom, but my proficiency has grown across the suite.

### Links and Profiles

- You can see all the video projects and stuff I've been making over at my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@uniqueuserwhat) This is by far currently my most active site, being the main hosting source for all my school work and the few fun side projects I've completed.

- You can see my photography at my incredibly outdated and semi-abandoned [DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/nousernamesleft).

- If you want to get all professional, you can creep on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tacostales/) I'm not on there very much (yet) so it's a little bare.



This one time, for one of the assignments in one of my classes, I drew two impossible shapes. It was incredibly difficult, but I'm very proud of them, and that's why I'm including a photo of each.

Look at them. They're amazing.
