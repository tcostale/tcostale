## Ask me about ...

HTML and Website design isn't necessarily my jam (as the great internet meme states, "I'm just a baby!"), but I do enjoy creative projects, and coding this kind of stuff has been a fun change of pace.

What I'm really into is video and photography. I kind of consider myself a professional ameture, if that makes sense.

You can see my photography at my incredibly outdated and semi-abandoned deviantart: here
And you can see all the video projects and stuff I've been making over at my youtube: here

The YouTube is WAY more active, and I've got some stuff I've worked on for school there, so check it out!
Don't forget to like and subscribe!

IF you want to get all professional, you can creep on my linkedin: here if you want. I'm not on there very much (yet) so it's a little bare.



This one time, for one of the assignments in one of my classes, I drew two impossible shapes. It was incredibly difficult, but I'm very proud of them, and that's why I'm including a photo of each.

Look at them. They're amazing.
