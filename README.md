## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Thomas. I'm currently a junior level student working towards a GIT degree, specializing in photography and film. My interests include photography and video editing (no surprises there), but also include gaming, and most recently lock picking.

I'm attending ASU through Starbucks College Achievement Plan, where I have been working for over 10 years. I started as a barista and promoted all the way up to Store Manager Trainer, before I suffered a work injury. During recovery, I stepped down to Shift Supervisor and began attending school to further my horizons and obtain a college degree.

## About me ...

### School
HTML and Website design isn't necessarily my jam, but I do enjoy creative projects, and coding this kind of stuff has been a fun change of pace.

### Skills and Hobbies
What I'm really into is video and photography. I kind of consider myself a professional ameture, if that makes sense.

### Links and Profiles


You can see my photography at my incredibly outdated and semi-abandoned [deviantart](https://www.deviantart.com/nousernamesleft)
And you can see all the video projects and stuff I've been making over at my youtube: here

The YouTube is WAY more active, and I've got some stuff I've worked on for school there, so check it out!
Don't forget to like and subscribe!

IF you want to get all professional, you can creep on my linkedin: here if you want. I'm not on there very much (yet) so it's a little bare.



This one time, for one of the assignments in one of my classes, I drew two impossible shapes. It was incredibly difficult, but I'm very proud of them, and that's why I'm including a photo of each.

Look at them. They're amazing.
